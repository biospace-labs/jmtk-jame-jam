BOOM!!!
You hear that? That's the sound of DISRUPTION.
And also the Hero's head getting exploded, hopefully.
Oh, don't give me that face.
I'm sure the townsfolk would throw a nice funeral.
(Yeah...)
If that happened to you, on the other hand?
I'm not sure anyone would even notice you were gone!
Better be careful, Sticky! Wa ha ha!
