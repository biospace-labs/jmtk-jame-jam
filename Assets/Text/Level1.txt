Oi! You there! New guy!
Er, 'Sticky', was it?
(It's Stockholm, actually, but--)
Well, Sticky, listen up:
The Hero's back in town,
and this year I refuse to lose!
That means we need levels. Dangerous ones.
As the newest member of our family,
the honour of building those levels is all yours.
Wa ha ha!
(Oh boy.)
Use WASD/Arrow Keys to move around,
E/Left-Click to pick up building materials,
and Space to interact with material dispensers
and blueprints.
Got all that?
(Um--)
Good! Wa ha ha!
You better get started quickly, 
or it'll look bad on your 
upcoming performance review!
