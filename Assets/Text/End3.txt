Hey, you managed to survive! Not bad!
If you keep this up,
I might even start paying you as early as next year.
Look forward to that! Wa ha ha!
For now, why don't you clock out for the day?
Our fresh shipment of lava isn't due 'til tomorrow.
(Ohhhh boy.)
Solid work today, Sticky.
See you tomorrow, bright and early!
